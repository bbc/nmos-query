    """
    Attempt to overcome the "missed etcd event" issue, which can be caused when
    processing of a return from a http long-poll takes too long, and an event is
    missed in etcd.

    This uses etcd's "waitIndex" functionality, which has the caveat that only
    the last 1000 events are stored. So, whilst this scheme should not miss events
    for fast updates, the case where 1000 updates occur within the space of a
    single event being processed will still be missed. This is unlikely, but still
    possible, so a "sentinel" message with action=index_skip will be sent to
    the output queue when this happens.

    To use this, the `queue' member of EtcdEventQueue is iterable:

    q = EtcdEventQueue()
    for message in q.queue:
        # process

    This uses http://www.gevent.org/gevent.queue.html as an underlying data
    structure, so can be consumed from multiple greenlets if necessary.
